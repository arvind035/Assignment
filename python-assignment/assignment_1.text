1. Values and Expressions:

    Values:
        'hello' (string)
        -87.8 (float)
        6 (integer)
    Expressions:
        - (subtraction operator)
        / (division operator)
        + (addition operator)

2. Difference Between String and Variable:

    String: A sequence of characters enclosed in quotes (e.g., 'hello').
    Variable: A named storage location in memory that can hold data values and be referenced (e.g., spam).

3. Three Different Data Types:

    Integer: Whole numbers without decimal points (e.g., 5, -3).
    Float: Numbers that contain decimal points (e.g., 3.14, -0.001).
    String: A sequence of characters, either single-quoted or double-quoted (e.g., 'text', "123").

4. Components of an Expression:

    An expression is made up of values, variables, and operators (e.g., a + b).
    All expressions compute a value or result.

5. Difference Between Expression and Statement:

    Expression: A combination of values and operators that evaluates to a value (e.g., 5 + 3).
    Statement: A line of code that performs an action but does not return a value (e.g., spam = 10).

6. Value of bacon After Running the Code:

    After the code bacon = 22 followed by bacon + 1, the variable bacon still contains 22 because the expression is not assigned back to bacon.

7. Values of the Two Terms:

    'spam' + 'spamspam' results in 'spamspamspam' (string concatenation).
    'spam' * 3 results in 'spamspamspam' (string repetition).

8. Validity of Variable Name:

    eggs is valid because it starts with a letter and contains only letters and underscores.
    100 is invalid because variable names cannot start with a digit.

9. Functions to Convert Values:

    int() for converting to an integer.
    float() for converting to a floating-point number.
    str() for converting to a string.

10. Error in Expression and Fix:

    The expression 'I have eaten ' + 99 + ' burritos.' causes an error because you cannot concatenate a string and an integer directly.
    Fix: Convert the integer to a string using str():
    'I have eaten ' + str(99) + ' burritos.'
