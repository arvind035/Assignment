1. Define the Bayesian interpretation of probability.

    Bayesian Interpretation:
        Probability is defined as a measure of belief or certainty regarding the occurrence of an event, expressed as a degree of belief that can be updated as new evidence is acquired. This approach contrasts with classical interpretations that define probability in terms of long-term frequency of events.

2. Define probability of a union of two events with equation.

    Probability of a Union:
        The probability of the union of two events AA and BB is defined as:
    P(A∪B)=P(A)+P(B)−P(A∩B)
    P(A∪B)=P(A)+P(B)−P(A∩B)
        This equation accounts for the overlap between the two events.

3. What is joint probability? What is its formula?

    Joint Probability:
        Joint probability is the probability of two events AA and BB occurring simultaneously.
        Formula:
    P(A∩B)=P(A∣B)⋅P(B)
    P(A∩B)=P(A∣B)⋅P(B)
        Here, P(A∣B)P(A∣B) is the conditional probability of AA given BB.

4. What is chain rule of probability?

    Chain Rule of Probability:
        The chain rule expresses the joint probability of a series of events as a product of conditional probabilities:
    P(A1,A2,…,An)=P(A1)⋅P(A2∣A1)⋅P(A3∣A1,A2)⋯P(An∣A1,A2,…,An−1)
    P(A1​,A2​,…,An​)=P(A1​)⋅P(A2​∣A1​)⋅P(A3​∣A1​,A2​)⋯P(An​∣A1​,A2​,…,An−1​)

5. What does conditional probability mean? What is the formula for it?

    Conditional Probability:
        Conditional probability is the probability of an event AA occurring given that another event BB has occurred.
        Formula:
    P(A∣B)=P(A∩B)P(B)for P(B)>0
    P(A∣B)=P(B)P(A∩B)​for P(B)>0

6. What are continuous random variables?

    Continuous Random Variables:
        These are variables that can take any value within a given range or interval. Their outcomes are not countable and are represented by a probability density function (PDF). Examples include heights, weights, and temperature.

7. What are Bernoulli distributions? What is the formula for it?

    Bernoulli Distribution:
        A Bernoulli distribution models a random experiment with exactly two possible outcomes (success or failure).
        Formula:
    P(X=1)=p,P(X=0)=1−p
    P(X=1)=p,P(X=0)=1−p
        Here, pp is the probability of success.

8. What is binomial distribution? What is the formula?

    Binomial Distribution:
        This distribution represents the number of successes in nn independent Bernoulli trials.
        Formula:
    P(X=k)=(nk)pk(1−p)n−k
    P(X=k)=(kn​)pk(1−p)n−k
        Where kk is the number of successes, nn is the number of trials, and pp is the probability of success.

9. What is Poisson distribution? What is the formula?

    Poisson Distribution:
        This distribution models the number of events occurring within a fixed interval of time or space, given a known average rate of occurrence.
        Formula:
    P(X=k)=λke−λk!
    P(X=k)=k!λke−λ​
        Where λλ is the average rate of occurrence and kk is the number of events.

10. Define covariance.

    Covariance:
        Covariance is a measure of how much two random variables change together. A positive covariance indicates that the variables tend to increase together, while a negative covariance indicates that one variable tends to increase when the other decreases.
        Formula:
    Cov(X,Y)=E[(X−μX)(Y−μY)]
    Cov(X,Y)=E[(X−μX​)(Y−μY​)]
        Where μXμX​ and μYμY​ are the means of XX and YY, respectively.

11. Define correlation.

    Correlation:
        Correlation is a statistical measure that describes the degree and direction of the linear relationship between two variables. It is standardized and ranges from -1 to 1.
        Formula:
    r=Cov(X,Y)σXσY
    r=σX​σY​Cov(X,Y)​
        Where σXσX​ and σYσY​ are the standard deviations of XX and YY.

12. Define sampling with replacement. Give an example.

    Sampling with Replacement:
        In this method, each selected item is "replaced" back into the population before the next selection, allowing for the same item to be chosen multiple times.
        Example:
        Drawing cards from a deck where, after each draw, the card is placed back into the deck.

13. What is sampling without replacement? Give an example.

    Sampling without Replacement:
        In this method, selected items are not returned to the population, ensuring that each item can only be selected once.
        Example:
        Drawing lottery tickets from a bowl where each ticket is not returned after it is drawn.

14. What is a hypothesis? Give an example.

    Hypothesis:
        A hypothesis is a testable statement or prediction about the relationship between two or more variables.
        Example:
        "Increasing the amount of sunlight a plant receives will increase its growth rate."
