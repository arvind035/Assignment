1. What are the key tasks that machine learning entails? What does data pre-processing imply?

    Key Tasks in Machine Learning:
        Problem Definition: Identify the objective and type of problem (classification, regression, etc.).
        Data Collection: Gather relevant data from various sources.
        Data Preprocessing: Clean and transform data to make it suitable for modeling, which includes handling missing values, outliers, and normalizing features.
        Feature Engineering: Create and select the most relevant features for training the model.
        Model Training: Train the model using training data.
        Model Evaluation: Assess model performance using validation and test sets.
        Deployment: Implement the model in a production environment.

    Data Preprocessing:
        It implies preparing raw data for analysis by cleaning, transforming, and organizing it to improve model accuracy and efficiency.

2. Describe quantitative and qualitative data in depth. Make a distinction between the two.

    Quantitative Data:
        Definition: Numerical data that can be measured and expressed mathematically.
        Examples: Height, weight, temperature, and sales revenue.
        Types: Discrete (countable values) and continuous (infinitely possible values).
        Analysis Methods: Statistical analysis, mean, median, mode, and standard deviation.

    Qualitative Data:
        Definition: Descriptive data that characterizes qualities or characteristics and cannot be measured numerically.
        Examples: Gender, nationality, and opinions.
        Types: Nominal (categories without order) and ordinal (categories with a meaningful order).
        Analysis Methods: Thematic analysis, frequency counts, and cross-tabulation.

    Distinction:
        Quantitative data is numerical and suitable for statistical analysis, while qualitative data is categorical and descriptive.

3. Create a basic data collection that includes some sample records. Have at least one attribute from each of the machine learning data types.
ID	Name	Age	Salary	Gender	Purchase History	Product Rating
1	Alice	30	70000	Female	["Laptop", "Phone"]	4.5
2	Bob	24	50000	Male	["Tablet", "Charger"]	4.0
3	Charlie	35	80000	Male	["Phone", "Headphones"]	5.0
4	Dana	28	60000	Female	["Laptop"]	4.2

    Attributes:
        Numeric: Age, Salary
        Categorical: Gender, Purchase History
        Ordinal: Product Rating (scale of 1-5)

4. What are the various causes of machine learning data issues? What are the ramifications?

    Causes of Data Issues:
        Missing Values: Incomplete records can lead to biased models.
        Outliers: Extreme values can skew results and mislead predictions.
        Inconsistent Data: Variability in data formats can cause confusion during analysis.
        Noise: Irrelevant or erroneous data can reduce model performance.
        Imbalanced Data: Disproportionate classes can lead to poor model training.

    Ramifications:
        Reduced model accuracy and reliability.
        Increased computational cost and time.
        Misleading insights and conclusions.

5. Demonstrate various approaches to categorical data exploration with appropriate examples.

    Approaches to Explore Categorical Data:
        Frequency Distribution: Count occurrences of each category.
            Example: Gender distribution in a dataset showing 60% female and 40% male.
        Cross-Tabulation: Analyze relationships between two categorical variables.
            Example: Analyzing product preferences by gender.
        Bar Charts: Visualize the frequency of categories.
            Example: A bar chart showing sales of different product categories.
        Chi-Square Test: Assess independence between categorical variables.
            Example: Testing if there is a relationship between age group and product preference.

6. How would the learning activity be affected if certain variables have missing values? Having said that, what can be done about it?

    Impact of Missing Values:
        Can lead to biased results, reduced dataset size, and loss of information.
        May cause algorithms to fail or produce inaccurate predictions.

    Solutions:
        Data Imputation: Fill in missing values with the mean, median, or mode.
        Removing Missing Data: Exclude records with missing values.
        Using Algorithms that Handle Missing Values: Some models (like decision trees) can handle missing data inherently.

7. Describe the various methods for dealing with missing data values in depth.

    a. Deletion:
        Listwise Deletion: Remove entire records with missing values.
        Pairwise Deletion: Use available data points for calculations while ignoring missing values in specific analyses.
    b. Imputation:
        Mean/Median/Mode Imputation: Replace missing values with the mean, median, or mode of the feature.
        K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Imputation: Use similar instances to estimate missing values based on feature similarity.
        Multiple Imputation: Create multiple datasets with different imputed values, analyze each, and combine results.
    c. Prediction Models:
        Use regression or classification models to predict missing values based on other variables in the dataset.

8. What are the various data pre-processing techniques? Explain dimensionality reduction and feature selection in a few words.

    Data Preprocessing Techniques:
        Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, outliers, and noise.
        Data Transformation: Normalize or standardize data.
        Data Encoding: Convert categorical variables into numerical form (e.g., one-hot encoding).
        Dimensionality Reduction:
            Definition: Reduce the number of features while retaining essential information.
            Example: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) transforms data into a lower-dimensional space.
        Feature Selection:
            Definition: Identify and select the most relevant features for model training.
            Example: Using techniques like Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) to determine important variables.

    i. What is the IQR? What criteria are used to assess it?
        IQR (Interquartile Range): The range between the first quartile (Q1) and the third quartile (Q3) that measures the spread of the middle 50% of data.
        Criteria: IQR = Q3 - Q1; used to identify outliers as values falling below Q1−1.5×IQRQ1−1.5×IQR or above Q3+1.5×IQRQ3+1.5×IQR.

    ii. Describe the various components of a box plot in detail. When will the lower whisker surpass the upper whisker in length? How can box plots be used to identify outliers?
        Components of a Box Plot:
            Box: Represents the IQR.
            Median Line: Shows the median value within the box.
            Whiskers: Extend from the box to the highest and lowest values within 1.5 * IQR.
            Outliers: Points outside the whiskers are considered outliers.
        Lower Whisker Surpassing Upper Whisker: This occurs in negatively skewed distributions where more values fall below the median.
        Outlier Identification: Box plots display outliers clearly as individual points beyond the whiskers.

10. Make brief notes on any two of the following:

    1. Data Collected at Regular Intervals:
        Data gathered at consistent time intervals (e.g., daily, weekly) allows for trend analysis and time series forecasting.
    2. The Gap Between the Quartiles:
        The gap between Q1 and Q3 indicates the IQR, providing insight into data dispersion. A larger gap signifies greater variability, while a smaller gap indicates data concentration.

11. Make a comparison between:

    1. Data with Nominal and Ordinal Values:
        Nominal Data: Categorical data without inherent order (e.g., colors, names).
        Ordinal Data: Categorical data with a defined order (e.g., rankings, education levels).

    2. Histogram and Box Plot:
        Histogram: Displays the frequency distribution of numerical data.
        Box Plot: Summarizes data distribution and highlights outliers.

    3. The Average and Median:
        Average (Mean): The sum of values divided by the count; sensitive to outliers.
        Median: The middle value when sorted; robust to outliers, providing a better central tendency measure in skewed distributions.
