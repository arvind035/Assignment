1. Provide an example of the concepts of Prior, Posterior, and Likelihood.

    Prior: Probability of event A before new evidence, e.g., P(A)=0.6P(A)=0.6.
    Posterior: Updated probability of event A after considering new evidence B, calculated as P(A∣B)=P(B∣A)⋅P(A)P(B)P(A∣B)=P(B)P(B∣A)⋅P(A)​.
    Likelihood: Probability of observing evidence B given event A, e.g., P(B∣A)=0.8P(B∣A)=0.8.

2. What role does Bayes' theorem play in the concept learning principle?

    Role: Bayes' theorem provides a mathematical framework for updating the probability of hypotheses based on observed evidence, facilitating effective learning from data.

3. Offer an example of how the Naïve Bayes classifier is used in real life.

    Example: Email filtering where the Naïve Bayes classifier assesses the probability of an email being spam based on the presence of certain keywords, classifying it accordingly.

4. Can the Naïve Bayes classifier be used on continuous numeric data? If so, how can you go about doing it?

    Yes: Continuous data can be handled by assuming a distribution (commonly Gaussian) for each feature and estimating parameters (mean and variance) to calculate probabilities.

5. What are Bayesian Belief Networks, and how do they work? What are their applications? Are they capable of resolving a wide range of issues?

    Definition: Bayesian Belief Networks are directed acyclic graphs representing a set of variables and their conditional dependencies via edges.
    How They Work: They use joint probability distributions to model relationships and infer probabilities of outcomes.
    Applications: Medical diagnosis, risk management, and decision-making processes.
    Issues Resolved: They effectively handle uncertainty, enabling complex reasoning under uncertainty.

6. Passengers are checked in an airport screening system... What are the chances that an alarm would be triggered when an individual is actually an intruder?

    Calculation:
        P(A=1∣I=1)=0.98P(A=1∣I=1)=0.98 (probability alarm triggers for intruder)
        Therefore, the probability that the alarm triggers when an individual is an intruder is 98%.

7. An antibiotic resistance test... Calculate the likelihood that a person who tests positive is actually immune (random variable D).

    Calculation:
        Given P(D∣T)=P(T∣D)⋅P(D)P(T)P(D∣T)=P(T)P(T∣D)⋅P(D)​:
            P(T∣D)=0.95P(T∣D)=0.95 (true positive)
            P(T∣¬D)=0.01P(T∣¬D)=0.01 (false positive)
            P(D)=0.02P(D)=0.02 (prevalence of resistance)
            Calculate P(T)P(T) using total probability.
        The likelihood that a person who tests positive is actually immune is about 0.66 or 66%.

8. In order to prepare for the test...

    What is the likelihood that the student can solve the exam problem?
        Calculation: P(S∣A)=0.9⋅0.3+0.2⋅0.2+0.6⋅0.5=0.39P(S∣A)=0.9⋅0.3+0.2⋅0.2+0.6⋅0.5=0.39.
    Given the student's solution, what is the likelihood that the problem was of form A?
        Calculation: Use Bayes' theorem: P(A∣S)=P(S∣A)⋅P(A)P(S)P(A∣S)=P(S)P(S∣A)⋅P(A)​, resulting in approximately 0.69.

9. A bank installs a CCTV system...

    How many customers come into the bank on a daily basis (10 hours)?
        Calculation: In 10 hours (600 minutes) with a 5% chance per 5 minutes, expected customers = 600×0.05=30600×0.05=30.
    On a daily basis, how many fake photographs and missed photographs are there?
        Fake photographs: 0.1×30=30.1×30=3
        Missed photographs: 0.01×30=0.30.01×30=0.3
    Explain likelihood that there is a customer if there is a photograph?
        Calculation: Use Bayes’ theorem: P(C∣P)=P(P∣C)⋅P(C)P(P)P(C∣P)=P(P)P(P∣C)⋅P(C)​.

10. Create the conditional probability table associated with the node Won Toss...

    Table:
        | Won Toss | A | B | C |
        |----------|---|---|---|
        | Yes | 0.3| 0.2| 0.5|
        | No | 0.7| 0.8| 0.5|

This table represents the probabilities of winning given each type of problem form (A, B, C) in a Bayesian context.
