1. What does one mean by the term "machine learning"?

    Definition: Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that involves training algorithms to learn from data, enabling them to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed for specific tasks.

2. Can you think of 4 distinct types of issues where it shines?

    1. Image Recognition: Identifying and classifying objects within images.
    2. Natural Language Processing: Understanding and generating human language, such as in chatbots.
    3. Fraud Detection: Identifying fraudulent activities in transactions.
    4. Recommendation Systems: Providing personalized recommendations based on user preferences and behavior.

3. What is a labeled training set, and how does it work?

    Definition: A labeled training set is a dataset where each input example is paired with the correct output label.
    Function: The model learns to associate inputs with outputs, allowing it to make predictions on unseen data by generalizing from the examples in the training set.

4. What are the two most important tasks that are supervised?

    1. Classification: Assigning input data to predefined categories.
    2. Regression: Predicting a continuous value based on input data.

5. Can you think of four examples of unsupervised tasks?

    1. Clustering: Grouping similar data points together.
    2. Anomaly Detection: Identifying outliers or unusual data points.
    3. Dimensionality Reduction: Reducing the number of features in a dataset while retaining important information.
    4. Association Rule Learning: Discovering interesting relations between variables in large databases.

6. State the machine learning model that would be best to make a robot walk through various unfamiliar terrains?

    Reinforcement Learning: This model enables the robot to learn optimal walking strategies through trial and error in dynamic environments, adapting to new terrains over time.

7. Which algorithm will you use to divide your customers into different groups?

    Clustering Algorithms: Algorithms like K-means or hierarchical clustering can be used to segment customers into distinct groups based on their characteristics or behaviors.

8. Will you consider the problem of spam detection to be a supervised or unsupervised learning problem?

    Supervised Learning: Spam detection is typically considered a supervised learning problem, as it relies on labeled examples of emails (spam vs. non-spam) to train the model.

9. What is the concept of an online learning system?

    Definition: An online learning system is a model that updates itself incrementally as new data becomes available, allowing it to adapt to changes in the data distribution in real-time.

10. What is out-of-core learning, and how does it differ from core learning?

    Out-of-Core Learning: Refers to learning algorithms that handle datasets too large to fit into memory by processing data in chunks.
    Difference: In-core learning processes data that fits entirely in memory, while out-of-core learning efficiently manages larger datasets.

11. What kind of learning algorithm makes predictions using a similarity measure?

    Instance-Based Learning Algorithms: Such algorithms, like K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), make predictions based on the similarity of new instances to instances in the training set.

12. What's the difference between a model parameter and a hyperparameter in a learning algorithm?

    Model Parameter: Internal configurations learned from training data, such as weights in a neural network.
    Hyperparameter: External configurations set before training, such as learning rate or the number of layers in a model.

13. What are the criteria that model-based learning algorithms look for? What is the most popular method they use to achieve success? What method do they use to make predictions?

    Criteria: They typically look for patterns or relationships in the data.
    Popular Method: Maximum likelihood estimation is commonly used.
    Prediction Method: Predictions are made based on the learned model's parameters and the input features.

14. Can you name four of the most important Machine Learning challenges?

    1. Overfitting: The model performs well on training data but poorly on unseen data.
    2. Data Quality: Inconsistent or noisy data can lead to inaccurate models.
    3. Computational Resources: High computational demand for training complex models.
    4. Interpretability: Difficulty in understanding and explaining model decisions, especially with complex models.

15. What happens if the model performs well on the training data but fails to generalize the results to new situations? Can you think of three different options?

    1. Regularization: Apply techniques like L1 or L2 regularization to prevent overfitting.
    2. Cross-Validation: Use cross-validation to assess model performance on unseen data during training.
    3. More Data: Increase the size of the training dataset to enhance generalization.

16. What exactly is a test set, and why would you need one?

    Definition: A test set is a separate portion of the dataset not used during training, meant to evaluate the model's performance.
    Purpose: It helps assess the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen data.

17. What is a validation set's purpose?

    Purpose: A validation set is used to tune hyperparameters and evaluate model performance during training, helping to avoid overfitting by providing feedback on model performance.

18. What precisely is the train-dev kit, when will you need it, how do you put it to use?

    Definition: The train-dev kit typically includes separate training and development (validation) datasets.
    Usage: It is used to train models and fine-tune hyperparameters, ensuring that the model's performance is robust before evaluation on the test set.

19. What could go wrong if you use the test set to tune hyperparameters?

    Overfitting Risk: Using the test set for tuning can lead to overfitting, as the model may perform well on the test set but poorly on new, unseen data, resulting in a lack of generalization.
