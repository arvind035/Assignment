1. How can each of these parameters be fine-tuned?

    Number of Hidden Layers:
        Experiment with adding or removing layers. Cross-validation can help determine the optimal number for better performance without overfitting.

    Network Architecture (Network Depth):
        Utilize architectures such as ResNet or DenseNet for deeper networks. Use grid search or random search to find the best architecture for the task.

    Each Layer's Number of Neurons (Layer Width):
        Vary the number of neurons in hidden layers based on complexity. More neurons may capture more features, but risk overfitting.

    Form of Activation:
        Test various activation functions like ReLU, sigmoid, or tanh. Consider using Leaky ReLU or ELU to mitigate vanishing gradient problems.

    Optimization and Learning:
        Choose optimization algorithms like Adam, SGD, or RMSprop based on convergence speed and stability. Hyperparameter tuning is essential.

    Learning Rate and Decay Schedule:
        Use learning rate schedulers (e.g., StepLR, ReduceLROnPlateau) to adjust learning rates based on training progress to avoid overshooting minima.

    Mini Batch Size:
        Experiment with different batch sizes to find a trade-off between convergence speed and stability. Smaller sizes can introduce more noise.

    Algorithms for Optimization:
        Evaluate various optimization algorithms based on your model architecture and data size, such as Adam, Nadam, or AdaGrad.

    The Number of Epochs (and Early Stopping Criteria):
        Monitor training and validation loss to decide the number of epochs. Implement early stopping to prevent overfitting when validation performance degrades.

    Overfitting that Can Be Avoided by Using Regularization Techniques:
        Incorporate dropout, L2 regularization, or early stopping to control overfitting by constraining the model complexity.

    L2 Normalization:
        Apply L2 regularization by adding a penalty to the loss function to discourage overly complex models.

    Dropout Layers:
        Introduce dropout layers in the network to randomly deactivate neurons during training, reducing overfitting.

    Data Augmentation:
        Use techniques like rotation, scaling, and flipping to artificially increase the diversity of training data, improving model robustness.
