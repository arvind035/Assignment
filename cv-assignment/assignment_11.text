Answers

1. What do REGION PROPOSALS entail?

    Definition: Region proposals are candidate bounding boxes generated around objects in an image that may contain objects of interest.
    Purpose: They help in reducing the search space for object detection models, allowing the network to focus on specific areas rather than the entire image.

2. What do you mean by NON-MAXIMUM SUPPRESSION? (NMS)

    Definition: Non-Maximum Suppression is a technique used to eliminate overlapping bounding boxes by retaining only the box with the highest confidence score.
    Function: It helps in refining the final set of detected objects by reducing multiple detections of the same object.

3. What exactly is mAP?

    Definition: Mean Average Precision (mAP) is a metric used to evaluate the accuracy of object detection models.
    Calculation: It averages the precision values across different recall levels, providing a comprehensive measure of a model's performance across various thresholds.

4. What is frames per second (FPS)?

    Definition: Frames per second (FPS) measures how many individual frames (images) a video or real-time system can process in one second.
    Importance: Higher FPS indicates smoother video playback and better real-time processing capabilities in object detection systems.

5. What is an IOU (INTERSECTION OVER UNION)?

    Definition: Intersection over Union (IoU) is a metric used to evaluate the overlap between two bounding boxes, calculated as the area of intersection divided by the area of union.
    Purpose: IoU is crucial in object detection for determining whether a predicted bounding box is accurate enough to be considered a correct detection.

6. Describe the PRECISION-RECALL CURVE (PR CURVE)

    Definition: The Precision-Recall curve plots precision (the fraction of true positive detections out of all positive detections) against recall (the fraction of true positive detections out of all actual positives).
    Use: It provides insight into the performance of a model, especially in imbalanced datasets, highlighting the trade-offs between precision and recall.

7. What is the term "selective search"?

    Definition: Selective search is an algorithm that generates region proposals by combining the strengths of both segmentation and object recognition.
    Process: It operates by segmenting an image into superpixels and then merging them based on color, texture, size, and shape, allowing for efficient proposal generation.

8. Describe the R-CNN model's four components.

    1. Region Proposal Network (RPN): Generates region proposals for potential object locations.
    2. Feature Extraction Network: Typically a pre-trained CNN that extracts features from proposed regions.
    3. Classifier: A classifier that assigns labels to the proposed regions based on extracted features.
    4. Bounding Box Regressor: Refines the bounding box coordinates of the predicted regions to improve localization accuracy.

9. What exactly is the Localization Module?

    Definition: The Localization Module is a component of object detection models that focuses on refining the coordinates of bounding boxes to ensure accurate localization of detected objects.
    Function: It adjusts the initial proposals generated by the RPN to fit the actual object shapes better, improving detection accuracy.

10. What are the R-CNN DISADVANTAGES?

    Slow Training: The R-CNN model is slow to train due to its reliance on a pre-trained CNN for feature extraction.
    High Memory Consumption: It requires significant memory for storing the features of each region proposal.
    Complex Pipeline: The multi-stage process (region proposal, feature extraction, classification, bounding box regression) adds complexity, making it less efficient than modern end-to-end models.
